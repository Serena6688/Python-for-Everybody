# Python_Learning_Journey
Here are some of my works for "Python for Everybody Specialization" at Coursera. This Specialization builds on the success of the Python for Everybody course and will introduce fundamental programming concepts including data structures, networked application program interfaces, and databases, using the Python programming language. In the Capstone Project, youâ€™ll use the technologies learned throughout the Specialization to design and create your own  applications for data retrieval, processing, and visualization.

My top three suggestions for code writing:
1. Think before writing; 2. Write with your mind; 3. Check the code before debugging
